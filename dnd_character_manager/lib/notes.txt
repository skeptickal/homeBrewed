To Do
1. Figure out Auth in a simple way for signing in, and retrieving data specific to the
    unique ID from the user who is signed in
2. Is there a way to create unique sessions? Like a DM who can see every person's 
    active character in the unique sessions, make edits to and view stats and spells? Potentially.
3. Compare Video's BLoC + Auth with Jeff's review of the structure, and find what I like best/what works best
    - need to follow up on this! Just simple client, BLoC, service method? Figure out users and logging in more on my own
    before watching a youtube tutorial
3. Streams? Or pull-to-refresh? Probably streams, can firebase use SQL queries? . . .
