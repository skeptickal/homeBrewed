v2 plans
1. D&D API free, integrate somewhat without compromising on customizability - find widget for dropdown + custom option?
2. Add visibility to typing option from obscure text on the password entry screen
3. Resize certain widgets and text better for screen size? - landscape v portrait? - create windows or mac os app version? 
4. add Maestro for testing?
5. Find different uses for Docker?
6. Add cubit to control different dropdown menus' size and items within, when receiving that data from the free D&D API
