v2 plans
1. D&D API free, integrate somewhat without compromising on customizability - find widget for dropdown + custom option?
2. Add visibility to typing option from obscure text on the password entry screen
3. Resize certain widgets and text better for screen size? - landscape v portrait? - create windows or mac os app version? 
4. add Maestro for testing?
5. Find different uses for Docker?
6. run bug? in debug mode?
